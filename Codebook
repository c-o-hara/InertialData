The subject and activity vectors are read in, both as numeric factor dataframes.
Subjects from: ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
Activities from: ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt

For each factor activity in the activity dataframe the activity labels are assigned to each activity. The activity labels come from ./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt file.

The test / train datasets are read into R as data frames from test files in ./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt. Similarly for train.

The data features (statistical features recorded by the researchers) are read from ./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt.

Each variable in the test / train dataframe is assigned its feature variable name.

The subject, activity and test / train datasets are merged column wise.

The names of both test and train variables (the statistical features) are made unique, to allow them to be merged by row later.

The data frames are merged to make one large data frame consisting of the test and train data sets.

Only those variables (features) that deal with the mean or standard deviation are selected and a subset of the data collected.

The data frame is ordered by subject number.

A tibble is created that groups by activity THEN subject, to allow for easy comparison between subjects on the same activity.

The mean of the variables (features detailing mean and standard deviation) are summarised by the mean withing their groups.

Finally thre resulting table is printed to a csv file. This gives the mean of each of the features by activity and subject.
